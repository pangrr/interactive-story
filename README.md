## Play Story

A good RPG can be fun. The soul of an RPG is a good story. Start playing an RPG requires less commitment than start reading a story. Yet making an RPG can be expensive. There are not as many good RPGs as there are good stories out there. 

Maybe not all good stories can become good RPGs. But we can try to play them, and wish more good stories will be revived.

Let's play stories.
