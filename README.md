## Play Story

A Role Playing Game (RPG) can be fun. The soul of an RPG is a good story. Making an RPG can be very expensive. Start playing an RPG requires less commitment than start reading/listening to a story. There are not as many good RPGs as there are good stories out there. Maybe not all good stories can become good RPGs. But we can try to play some of them, and wish more good stories will be alive in more people's mind.

Let's play stories.
